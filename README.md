# Home-Assistant-Climate-Trinity

Since there is no support for climatics from the german manufacturer Trinnity for heatpumps in Home-Assitant yet,
and some of them have no WiFi, I created a project on my own to make them accessable in Home-Assistent. 
To do this, I have read out the IR-Data from the original remote of the TW33HP. With an RPC32
and an IR - Transmitter, wich is placed near the original receiver, the signals are integrated to the YAML-Code
of the RPC32 in Home-Assistant. 
A second RPC32 is used to messure the temperature in the Room. 

I Used the following Components:
- [Power-Supply](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07KXQZKRW)
- [Microcontroller](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07Z83MF5W)
- [Receiver](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B089QKGRTL)
- [Transmitter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07KXQZKRW)
