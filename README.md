# Home-Assistant-Climate-Trinity

Since there is no support for climatics from the germen manufacturer Trinnity in Home-Assitant yet,
I created a project on my own. 
For the Project i have read out the IR-Data from the original remote of the TW33HP. With an RPC32
and an IR - Transmitter, wich is placed near the original receiver, the signals are integrated to the YAML-Code
of the RPC32 in Home-Assistant. 
A second RPC32 is used to messure the temperature in the Room. 

The Interface:
